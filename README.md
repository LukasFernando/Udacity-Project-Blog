## Now we gonna talk aboult each CRISP-DM step
 
### Business Understanding
<p> This step is the process to understand the problem. This way you can plan what you gonna do with the data and you know why that you doing this. It's important to know why and what you do with the data, it isn't just to solve the problem, you must know the value of this problem. 
  
### Data Understanding
<p> This step is about understand and identify the relevant data to the project goals. 

### Prepare Data
<p> Here all the data that'll be used is determined. Also, the process how the data will be clean.

### Data Modeling
<p> This is the coolest step. Here you'll clear the data. Everything you identified that is not relevant to the project is drop at this step. You will let the data clean to use. 

### Evaluate the Results
<p> This step is about evaluating the result, models and process. This step will also check if the process makes sense and it is scalable.

### Deploy
<p> This step is about the planning. Summarizing all the process and planning how it'll be deployed in the future. Also, planning the monitoring and maintenance.
